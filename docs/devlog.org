This goes over some fundamental techniques of game developing, I think.

1. In general, favor compositional design when possible. [1]
2. In general, favor pure functions when possible. [2]


* Pure Functions
A pure function lacks side-effects, which means that it does not modify the /state/ of things. An example of an impure function is as follows:

#+begin_src python
def increase_rating(player, increase):
    player.rating += increase # This is a side-effect

increase_rating(my_player, 100)
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
def increase_rating(player, increase):
    return player.rating + increase

player.rating = increase_rating(player, 100)
#+end_src
