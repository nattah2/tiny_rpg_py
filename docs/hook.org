#+title: Hook

* Class Overview
An ~EffectHook~ is something that is attached to a ~Stats~ object.
* IDEA ~attach~
Currently, it takes one character, but thinking about it, it might need to take multiple characters - say for an AOE effect.
* TODO ~attach~
It should properly account for stacking effects.

e.g. a burn cannot be applied multiple times but a defense down can.
